# Question Templates

Use these templates to gather information based on issue type. Adapt questions to the specific context.

## Feature / Enhancement Questions

1. **Goal**: What problem does this solve or what value does it add?
2. **Users**: Who will use this feature?
3. **Behavior**: What should the feature do? (expected behavior)
4. **Scope**: What is explicitly out of scope?
5. **Dependencies**: Are there any prerequisites or related features?
6. **Acceptance**: How will we know this is complete?

## Bug Report Questions

1. **Expected**: What should happen?
2. **Actual**: What actually happens?
3. **Steps**: How can we reproduce this?
4. **Environment**: What version/environment are you using?
5. **Frequency**: Does this always happen or intermittently?
6. **Workaround**: Is there a current workaround?

## Documentation Questions

1. **Topic**: What needs to be documented?
2. **Audience**: Who is the target reader?
3. **Location**: Where should this documentation live?
4. **Existing**: What related documentation exists?
5. **Examples**: Should code examples be included?

## Refactor Questions

1. **Target**: What code/component needs refactoring?
2. **Problem**: What's wrong with the current implementation?
3. **Goal**: What should the refactored code achieve?
4. **Constraints**: What must remain unchanged (APIs, behavior)?
5. **Tests**: Are there existing tests covering this code?

## Adapting Questions

- Skip questions the user has already answered
- Combine related questions to reduce back-and-forth
- Use follow-up questions only when clarification is needed
- Prioritize questions that impact issue scope and acceptance criteria
- For small issues, 2-3 questions may suffice
